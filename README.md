## Scenario

We’re building a new Food and Recipe web application! We’ve just started, and we’re still working on the basics. Right now we just have a page that lists all the ingredients in our database, and we need to progress on a few more initial features.

For each exercise, write a short description of your approach, and discuss any other alternative approaches you considered, and why you went with your chosen approach. 

## Exercise #1

Implement a feature to add new ingredients. Provide the user with a simple interface where they can supply the name for a new ingredient and save it to the database. This can be done on a new page, or using the existing index page.

## Exercise #2

We’ve received a list of ingredients that we need to import into our database. We expect this to be a one-time import. The list is in a text file, with one ingredient per line. Implement a way to import this data. 

## Exercise #3

We noticed that there’s no protection against an ingredient existing in our database twice. Make updates to your solution from Exercise #1 We also need to ensure duplicate ingredients are removed from the database.

## Exercise #4

Write Rspec tests for your solutions. Complete test coverage isn't necessary, so only write tests that you think are useful.
