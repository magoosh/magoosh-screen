## Scenario

We’re building a new Food and Recipe web application! We’ve just started, and we’re still working on the basics. Right now we just have a page that lists all the ingredients in our database, and we need to progress on a few more initial features.

For each exercise, write a short description (in this file is fine) of your approach, and discuss any other alternative approaches you considered, and why you went with your chosen approach. 

## Exercise #1

Implement a feature to add new ingredients. Provide the user with a simple interface where they can supply the name for a new ingredient and save it to the database. This can be done on a new page, or using the existing index page.

## Exercise #2

We’ve received a list of ingredients that we need to import into our database. We expect this to be a rare occurence, such that we don't need to implement a feature on the site to accomplish this, but instead just need a reusable process to occasionally import ingredients. The list is in a text file, named ingredients.txt. Implement a process to import this data. 

## Exercise #3

We noticed that there’s no protection against an ingredient existing in our database more than once. Implement changes to the project, and to your solution from Exercise #1 if appropriate, to ensure duplicate ingredients are not allowed. We also need to ensure any duplicate ingredients are removed from the database.

## Exercise #4

We haven't written any tests! Write some basic tests for this project, mainly focusing on convering the code you wrote for the above exercises. Full test coverage is not necessary, so only focus on what tests you think are the most useful.
